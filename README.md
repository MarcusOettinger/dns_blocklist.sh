# dns_blocklist.sh #
Create a DNS-blocklist for use with unbound or dnsmasq

## source ##
The script was found on [https://github.com/sfeakes/ipfire-scripts](https://github.com/sfeakes/ipfire-scripts) - kudos to sfeakes.
I adapted the original simply to suit my needs.

## description ##
The script will download a list of hosts / domains that are labeled as malicious from multiple sources and create a file that will cause unbound or dnsmasq to block them via DNS queries.
The file will have duplicates and most (if not all) bad entries removed.  If you use the experimental nxdomain option, will also have duplicate sub domains removed.
For retreiving sources, Host file format and adblock format is supported.
DNS configurations for unbound and dnsmasq are supported, if you want to write a local hosts file, you will need to modify the output with you local configuration.

To install, download the script, copy to the desired location and chmod 755 dns_blocklist.sh.

Then simply run the script every time you want to update the blocklist or use your favourite cron to run it in regular intervals.

### If you are using dnsmasq instead of unbound, there is one further step ###
- create a file `/etc/sysconfig/dnsmasq` with following the contents
- `CUSTOM_ARGS="--addn-hosts=/var/ipfire/dhcp/blocked.hosts"`

### Command line parameters ###
```
./dns_blocklist.sh <parameters>
  Parameters are the following, only use one of the formats, -p OR --parameter, do not use both
  -h --help                 This message
  -l --listsources          list sources available with index number
  -w --whitelist <filename> Use a white list file
  -b --blacklist <filename> Use a blacklist file
  -r --dns <ip or value>    Set the dns return value
  -u --force_unbind         Force script to use unbind
  -d --force_dnsmasq        Force script to use dnsmasq
  -o --outfile <filename>   output to filename, do not restart any services
  -s --sourcelist <list>    list sources to retreive blacklist from (must be comma seperated)
                            use index number from -l value or URL

Example:-  ./dns_blocklist.sh -s 1,2,http://mylist.com/host.txt -r 0.0.0.0
```
#### Custom blacklist & whitelist  ####
Example
```
dns_blocklist.sh –b ~/user/blacklist.hosts
dns_blocklist.sh –w ~/user/whitelist.hosts
```

Change the above to point to your custom files. The files should contain domain names only. blacklist will be added to the DNS block list, whitelist will be used to remove any entries that match from the source blocklists that are downloaded.
```
# example blacklist /var/ipfire/dhcp/blacklist
activate.adobe.com
www.trovi.com
cdn.wanderburst.com
www.wanderburst.com
d13.zedo.com
d3.zedo.com
wanderburst.akamaihd.net
wanderburst-a.akamaihd.net
```

#### IP that the DNS server returns  ####
Example
```
dns_blocklist.sh –r 127.0.0.1
dns_blocklist.sh –r refuse
```

Change to any IP you like, the default is 127.0.0.1 for both dnsmasq & unbound

##### unbound nxdomain **EXPERIMENTAL use only** #####

By default this script will tell the dns server to return a IP address for each entry, this means the source lists have to be very accurate and no wildcards can be used. For example, if your blocklist contains :-
```
 junk1.doubleclick.net
 junk2.doubleclick.net
 doubleclick.net
 ad.junk1.doubleclick.net
 adjunk.google.com
```

Only those exact domains will be rejected. This will allow all subdomains, ie `ad2.junk1.doubleclick.net & junk3.doubleclick.net` to be accepted.  
If you look at some of the lists from the sources, you will see hundreds of sub domains that all need to be blocked, and constantly get updated as new ones come out.

With the “experimental nxdomain” option set, the script will sort all those domains down to the minimum, and block everything under that. In the example above it will simple use `doubleclick.net`, and block that and every domain under it. `eg *.doubleclick.net`

To turn this option on, set the command line parameter -r or --dns to either `refuse`, `static`, `always_refuse` or `always_nxdomain`. Description of these can be found in the "local-zone": section of the following URL.
https://www.unbound.net/documentation/unbound.conf.html

Using the above list, running the script in normal mode will create a file like
```
local-data: "junk1.doubleclick.net A 127.0.0.1"
local-data: "junk1.doubleclick.net A 127.0.0.1"
local-data: "junk2.doubleclick.net A 127.0.0.1"
local-data: "doubleclick.net A 127.0.0.1"
local-data: "ad.junk1.doubleclick.net A 127.0.0.1"
local-data: "adjunk.google.com A 127.0.0.1"
```

Running the scrtipt in expermental nxdomain would create the following
```
local-zone: "doubleclick.net" reject
local-zone: "adjunk.google.com" reject
```

#### Enable / Disable known sources and Add new sources for the blocklist generation  ####
Example
```
dns_blocklist.sh -l
dns_blocklist.sh -s 1,2,5
dns_blocklist.sh -s 1,2,http://mylist.com/host.txt 
dns_blocklist.sh -s 1,"http://pgl.yoyo.org/as/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext"
```

List all knows sources with the –l parameter. This will list sources with an ID next to each, use this ID with the -s parameter.  
Enable sources with –s Can be a list of numbers and urls, that are comma separated and contain no spaces.  If a number is used, the corresponding known source will be used to download sources from, if a url is used, the script will try to download content from that url. If you need to pass query parameters, then quots muse be used. 

### Below are a list of the sources that can be configured (turned on or off) with -s parameter ###

Sources markes as *Adblock*, are not the best source format as they are specific to web browser blocking and not domain level blocking. But this script will pass the format and extract any TLD's that are listed.
